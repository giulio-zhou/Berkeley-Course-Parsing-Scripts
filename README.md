# Berkeley-Course-Parsing-Scripts

Since Berkeley does not support an API to fetch course information,
I've devised these set of scripts to grab data from the course pages
located at http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses.

Run the script using >>> python parse\_class\_html.py <br>
Returns an output directory where all class data is group into their 
own respective directories by subject. <br>
Example output: <br>
COMPSCI 170 <br>
