# Berkeley-Course-Parsing-Scripts

Since Berkeley does not support an API to fetch course information,
I've devised these set of scripts to grab data from the course pages
located at http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses.

Run the script using >>> python parse_class_html.py
Returns an output directory where all class data is group into their
own respective directories by subject.
Example output:
